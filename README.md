## About 

TIHMMI - Temperature Infrared Humidity Mobile Mapping Instrument (pronounced "Timmy" as a shoutout to Tim Oke) - is a low-cost and open-source Arduino based sensor system designed to simultaneously map air and surface temperature in cities.

Central application of the system is teaching - create touchpoints to engage with open source / science / scholarship in the context of urban climate 

The system is developed in a collaboration between the University of British Columbia (Canada), University of Freiburg (Germany), and CIG-IGEHCS (CONICET/UNCPBA, Argentina) with support from the Mozilla Foundation.

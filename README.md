## About

TIHMMI - Temperature Infrared Humidity Mobile Mapping Instrument (pronounced "Timmy" as a shoutout to Tim Oke) - is an arduino based sensor system designed to map temperature, humidity, and infrared reflectance on mobile platforms. 

## Goals/Objectives

The goal of the TIHMMI project is to develop a high precision mobile urban heat island mapping (UHI) system that is open source and affordable. We are furthermore interested in using TIHMMI as a tool for enhancing technological literacy by providing support to reproduce the technology and recommendations for use. We hope that TIHMMI can be used to help researchers and citizens alike pursue their research interests and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the climate of cities.


## Code of Conduct
We value the participation of all contributors. To help maintain a welcoming and safe atmosphere we have a [code of conduct that is set forth by Mozilla Science](https://mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct). We are dedicated to maintaining and enforcing this code of conduct. We totally encourage positive and respectful behavior and completely discourage the opposite.

# Getting Started

## Parts and Purchasing

Please see the [purchasing list](purchasing.md) for the list of components, pricing, and where to purchase the parts. 

## Build your own TIHMMI
There are two components of your TIHMMI - the hardware and the software. You will first need to construct your TIHMMI and then upload the software. 

### Hardware

The instructions for building your TIHMMI can be found [here]().

### Software

Upload the TIHMMI software to the microcontroller [here]().

## Data Processing

We've developed a few handy scripts to help get your TIHMMI data into shape. You can learn how to use and run them [here](). 

Feel free to use your own scripts or remix ours. If you come up with a system you feel is more robust or useful, please feel free to shoot us a message or make a pull request ðŸ˜Ž

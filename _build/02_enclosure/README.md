# Building an enclosure

You can prety much use any type of container to enclose the sensors that will be sitting in, but we've created some files that you can use to laser cut some acrylic. 

The acrylic we used was Xmm in thickness.

## Materials

* A sheet of acrylic, ~24 in x 18 in
* A laser cutter
* Acrylic adhesive

## Laser cutting

Please consult your laser cutting expert on the best settings to cut your acryclic.  Doing some test cuts is recommended.
